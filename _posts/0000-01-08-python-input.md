### Input

1. Add to the hello.py file
`name = input()`
`print('hello there ' + name)`

**name** is a variable, you are saving off what results from the input function
**input()** is a function that takes no parameters as it's waiting on user input in the command line, by default saves as a string
**'hello there ' + name** concatenation - adding a string 'hello there ' to the string saved in the name variable
